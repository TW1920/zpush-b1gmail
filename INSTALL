Installing the Z-Push b1gMail backend
=====================================

Requirements
------------
The Z-Push b1gMail backend requires Z-Push 2.1 and b1gMail >= 7.3.0-Beta5.
b1gMail has to be in UTF-8 mode.

Installing
----------
At first, Z-Push has to be installed as described in its INSTALL file.

To add the b1gMail backend, create a folder called backend/b1gmail/ in
your Z-Push directory and copy the  PHP files of the b1gMail backend
archive into that directory.

Once the files have been copied, edit Z-Push's config.php file and set 
the backend provider to 'BackendB1GMail' by modifying the appropriate
line:
	define('BACKEND_PROVIDER', 'BackendB1GMail');

The backend also needs to have access to your b1gMail MySQL database.
Add the following lines to the config.php file and change the MySQL
login according to your environment:
	define('B1GMAIL_DB_HOST',		'localhost');
	define('B1GMAIL_DB_USER',		'root');
	define('B1GMAIL_DB_PASS',		'password');
	define('B1GMAIL_DB_DB',			'b1gmail');
	define('B1GMAIL_DB_PREFIX',		'bm60_');

Allow synchronization in the b1gMail ACP at 'Users & Groups' =>
'Groups' to allow access to the Z-Push service.

Setting up your mobile device

Troubleshooting
---------------
