b1gMail Z-Push backend
======================

IMPORTANT! The connector now requires Z-Push 2.1.0 or newer.

This is a Z-Push backend which conntects to a b1gMail database. It requires b1gMail >= 7.3.0-Beta5. See INSTALL file for installation instructions.

The backend is still in early development and may not work as expected.
